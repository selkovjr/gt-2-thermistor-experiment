# GT-2 thermistor experiment

How good is this thermistor?

Thanks to [David Crocker](https://github.com/dc42) who has identified this thermistor, now I at least know where it came from. It is a [104GT glass thermistor by ATC Semitec](http://www.atcsemitec.co.uk/gt-2-glass-thermistors.html). The code name simply means (an approximately) 100&#13248; Glass Thermistor.
