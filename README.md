# GT-2 thermistor experiment

## How good is this thermistor?

Thanks to [David Crocker](https://github.com/dc42) who has identified this thermistor, now I at least know where it came from. It is a 104GT glass thermistor by ATC Semitec). The code name obviously means *"an (approximately) 100k&Omega; Glass Thermistor"*. This is how we know:

The colored lines are [resistance-temeperature tables](https://github.com/selkovjr/gt-2-thermistor-experiment/blob/master/gt-2-glass-thermistors.tab) from [ATC Semitec's product leaflet](http://www.atcsemitec.co.uk/gt-2-glass-thermistors.html); black dots are the measurements I took from the thermistor I received with the [BiQu Diamond hotend](https://www.biqu.equipment/products/diamond-3d-printer-extruder-reprap-hotend-3d-v6-heatsink-3-in-1-out-multi-nozzle-extruder-prusa-i3-kit-for-1-75-0-4mm) I bought on eBay.
